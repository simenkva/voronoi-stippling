# Voronoi Stippling

A browser-based Voronoi stippling tool that turns images into dot patterns using weighted sampling and iterative relaxation.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop or load images (plus a built-in demo image).
- Control dot count, iterations, sampling density, gamma, and relaxation strength.
- Toggle inversion and source preview.
- Export the result as SVG or PNG.

## Usage
1. Open `stippling.html` in a modern browser.
2. Drop an image onto the left panel or click the upload control.
3. Adjust controls and click Run or Step to iterate.
